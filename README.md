# jboss-api

Java EE basic REST application that can be deployed on [JBoss EAP7](https://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/download/).  Unlike other starters this is a lightweight project that uses all the built in modules from JBoss

## To get started
Import as a dynamic web project in [JBoss Developer Studio](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/developer-studio)

Once deployed, you can see a status value at
`jboss-api/status

This project works to create a [Angular Resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource) REST api that works with [jboss client](https://github.com/mechevarria/jboss-client) and can do all CRUD operations on the `jboss-api/item` endpoint

You can also import the environment and tests as a collection to [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
